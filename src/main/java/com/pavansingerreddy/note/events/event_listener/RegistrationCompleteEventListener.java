    // The @Async annotation in Spring is used to indicate that a method should be
    // executed in a separate thread, i.e., asynchronously. When a method is
    // annotated with @Async, Spring will execute it in a separate thread and the
    // caller can continue with other tasks without waiting for the completion of
    // the called method. NOTE : To enable the use of @Async in a Spring
    // application, we need to add @EnableAsync in one of our configuration classes.

    // adding transactional annotation so that all the transactions in this event
    // happen in a single hibernate session and not on different hibernate session
    // which may cause error In the context of Hibernate, a transaction is
    // associated with a Session. The @Transactional annotation ensures that all the
    // operations in the method occur within the same Hibernate Session. This can
    // help avoid issues with detached entities, which can occur when an entity is
    // fetched in one Session and then used in another. So, when we annotate the
    // onApplicationEvent method with @Transactional, we are ensuring that the
    // fetching of the User and the saving of the VerificationToken both happen
    // within the same Hibernate Session. This can help avoid the detached entity
    // passed to persist error.
